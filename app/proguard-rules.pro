# 1.1.11 (Google Play): R8 for a Play upload (-Ppocketxr.play=true). Conservative: Pocket XR's own classes and the
# libraries that are reached from native code, by reflection or through Binder keep their names and members, so only
# unused library code is removed and the rest of the libraries are renamed. The mapping goes to Play with the bundle.

# Pocket XR: reflection on hidden Android APIs, the Shizuku user service (started by class name), AIDL stubs.

# Shizuku: the binder handed over by its provider, and the user service it starts.

# WorkManager (brought by a library) finds its Room database by class name; R8 broke that at start on the first try.

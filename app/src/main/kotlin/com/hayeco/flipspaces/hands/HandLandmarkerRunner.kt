/**
 * MediaPipe Hand Landmarker (com.google.mediapipe:tasks-vision) in live stream mode: frames go
 * in with detectAsync, results come back on MediaPipe's thread. [numHands] hands are tracked
 * (0.5.4: one by default, see [HandsPrefs.twoHands]).
 *
 * In live stream mode MediaPipe runs its palm detector only when it has no hand to follow: once
 * a hand is found, the next frame's hand region comes from this frame's landmarks, and the palm
 * detector runs again only when the tracked hand's presence or tracking confidence drops below
 * the thresholds set here, or while fewer than [numHands] hands are tracked: with two, one hand
 * in view pays for the palm detector on every frame (Mike's logs: about 30 ms a frame with no
 * hand, the palm detector alone, and 45 to 62 ms with one hand, both models). That needs frames close together in time with increasing capture
 * timestamps, which is why the pipeline feeds the newest frame as soon as the previous result
 * is in.
 *
 * 0.5.8, two hands: two landmarkers, one following one hand and one following two, and
 * [PalmSearch] picks which gets each frame. While fewer than two hands are tracked the one hand
 * landmarker gets the frames (its palm detector off while it tracks) and the two hand one gets
 * one frame in four to look for the second hand; once it sees two it gets every frame. So the
 * palm detector no longer runs on every frame with one hand in view (Mike's 0.5.6 log: 15 fps,
 * about 30 dropped a second).
 *
 * The GPU delegate is tried first; if MediaPipe cannot build it, or it fails on its first
 * frames, the runner falls back to the CPU (XNNPACK). 0.5.14: up to [MAX_IN_FLIGHT] images are
 * in flight ([awaitReady] takes a slot, [submit] sends; a result frees it); a graph rebuild waits
 * for none ([awaitIdle]).

/**
 * A Bluetooth or USB mouse, on the phone or a Beam Pro, while the Space is up ([PhysicalMouse] maps it). Before this
 * nothing in the Space read a mouse: Android drew its own arrow on whichever display it was on, the Space's GL view
 * dropped its events, and on the phone a click on the trackpad's pad was taken as a finger's tap.
 *
 * Where the mouse's events land depends on the phone: on the display Android's arrow is on, so on the Space's window
 * (the glasses) or the trackpad's (the phone). Both feed this one route. A view [attach]ed here hides Android's arrow
 * over it and, while its window has focus, captures the pointer ([View.requestPointerCapture]), so the mouse's raw
 * motion comes to Pocket XR's pointer alone and Android's arrow never fights it or wanders off to another display.
 * Without focus (a window's app took it) the events still come uncaptured, with Android's relative motion.
 *
 * Main thread.

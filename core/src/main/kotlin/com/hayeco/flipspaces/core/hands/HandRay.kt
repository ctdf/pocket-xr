/**
 * The glasses camera as a pinhole (0.5.0): a normalised
 * image point (x, y in 0..1 across the upright frame) becomes a direction in the camera's frame,
 * then in the head frame (x right, y up, -z forward, metres from the head centre) through
 * [yawDeg], [pitchDeg], [rollDeg] and [offset].
 *
 * The Aura publishes no intrinsics or extrinsics (no published camera model), so the defaults
 * are our estimates, looking straight ahead from the bridge of the glasses, 1 cm above and 1 cm
 * in front of the eyes' centre. The user calibration ([RayCalibration]) takes up what they get
 * wrong.
 *
 * 0.5.10: 68 by 41.6 degrees across the 16:9 frame (was 80 by 51). 0.5.0 to 0.5.9 took the "80
 * degrees" as the frame's width; a camera's quoted angle is its diagonal, and 80 degrees on the
 * diagonal of a 4:3 sensor whose full width the 1080p picture keeps is 68 degrees across. Too wide
 * an angle per pixel puts every hand further from the centre than it is, by more the further out
 * it is: Mike's right hand's cursor right of his aim, his left hand's left of it (10/22). Two older
 * measurements point the same way: 0.4.8's air box, which put the cursor near the hand, spread
 * the picture's middle 0.7 over the display, and 0.5.0's palm size distances with 80 degrees sat on
 * their 0.2 m clamp for hands at arm's length ([AURA_HFOV_DEG]).

 *   0.5.1: 6, 8 and 2 cm instead of 15, 20 and 5.
 * - The origin is [blend] of the way from the wrist to the shoulder: 0.5.0 used 0.53; 0.5.1
 *   starts at the shoulder itself (1), since with a fixed distance an origin near the wrist and
 *   a hand point at the same depth give a ray across the picture, not into it.
 * - The hand's distance is [fixedDepthM] (0.45 m) until the camera's field of view is measured;
 *   null uses the size estimate ([CameraModel.depthOf]), smoothed with its own One Euro filter
 *   ([depthMinCutoffHz]). The origin is smoothed per axis ([originMinCutoffHz]).
 * - [eyeViewAtM]: the cursor goes where the ray is that far out, seen from the eyes, so the

 * takes that hand's ray (head frame, uncalibrated) and works out the direction the ray should
 * have had to pass through the dot, since its origin is not the eye. After the last dot
 * [result] fits a [RayCalibration] and says whether it is good enough ([maxRmsDeg]).

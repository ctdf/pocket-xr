/**
 * 0.5.20 (Mike: "when I select apps in the app launcher, the cursor is drawn behind the launcher
 * panel, although selecting still works"): where the cursor is drawn, so it is always in front of
 * every surface it covers, in both eyes.
 *
 * Why it was behind: the cursor was drawn last with no depth test, so it was on top in each eye's
 * picture, but its place in the room was behind the launcher. Over the open launcher (or the control
 * panel, or the home tile) the pointer claims the ray, so nothing is hovered, and the cursor went to
 * its "over nothing" distance: 2.5 m for the trackpad's reticle, 2 m for a hand's dot. The launcher
 * is 1.0 m away. In side by side 3D each eye sees the cursor with the disparity of 2 to 2.5 m and the
 * launcher with that of 1 m, so the eyes fuse the cursor 1 to 1.5 m behind a panel that is drawn
 * over it: it looks behind. In 2D (no disparity) it showed on top. A hand's dot had a second fault:
 * 2 m along the hand's ray is not on the eye's line to the tile the hand points at.
 *
 * Now the cursor's point is found in three steps: (1) along the pointer's ray, at the hovered
 * surface ([hoverM]) or, when the launcher or a menu claims the ray, at that surface (a sphere of
 * [claimM] round the head, met by the ray from wherever it starts), else [defaultM]; (2) seen from
 * the eyes, never behind the nearest window, curved or flat, or its controls on that line of sight
 * ([PanelHitTester.nearest] along the eye's ray to the point); (3) while the launcher or a menu is
 * open, never behind it. Each pulled in to [IN_FRONT_M] before the surface. Its size is a constant
 * angle from the eyes, so moving it along the line of sight changes nothing in 2D and puts it in
 * front in 3D.

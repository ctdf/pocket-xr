/**
 * 0.5.37 (Mike: "an Immersive button which makes it so only that window appears as a perfectly sized movie like widescreen
 * experience, with auto dimming making the other open app windows, in a cool motion designed visual way, disappear into
 * nothingness, leaving an immersive movie watching experience, kind of like Apple Vision Pro").
 *
 * The motion, in the premium manner (no overshoot, eased both ends for the hero, ease in for what leaves):
 * - **Entering**: the hero window glides from where it is to the cinema spot ([cinema]: straight ahead at [CINEMA_M], as big as fits
 *   in [FIT] of the view, its own shape kept) over [ENTER_MS]. Every other window recedes to [RECEDE] times its distance
 *   (so it shrinks as it goes) and fades to nothing, one after the other [STAGGER_MS] apart, each over [LEAVE_MS].
 * - **Exiting**: the hero glides back over [EXIT_MS]; the others come back from the distance and fade in, staggered.
 * Hidden windows take no presses ([hidden]). The end of each phase is committed (saved, the hero's display resized).

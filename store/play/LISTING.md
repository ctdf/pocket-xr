## Short description (80 max)

```
Your Android apps as windows around you on XREAL glasses, run from your phone
```

## Full description (4000 max)

```
Pocket XR turns an Android phone and a pair of XREAL glasses into a multi-window workspace. Your apps float around you as windows you can move, resize, curve and push back. Head tracking keeps them in place, and the phone becomes the controller.

WINDOWS IN SPACE
- Any app opens as a window around you, at its own size and distance.
- Drag windows by their edges, snap them side by side, curve them, push them further or pull them closer.
- Move, push, pull or resize every window at once.
- Arrange layouts and presets that reopen a set of windows where they were.
- A launcher with search, the time, and your phone's battery, signal and Wi-Fi.
- A Control Center for layouts, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, notifications and recentring.
- Record the glasses: a clean video of what you see, saved on your phone.

SEEING IT
- 3D side by side, with each window at a real depth.
- Head tracking from the glasses' own motion sensor, paced to their display.

CONTROLS
- The phone as a trackpad, with taps, two-finger scroll and pinch, and three-finger swipes.
- The Spatial Mouse: point the phone like a laser.
- Hand tracking on glasses with a camera (XREAL Aura).

WHAT IT NEEDS
- A phone whose USB-C port carries video (DisplayPort alt mode), on Android 11 or later.
- XREAL glasses: the Aura and the One are tested; the One Pro and 1S are in community testing.
- Shizuku, a free app, to create a window for each app.
- Optional: the Pocket XR add-on, for the cursor outside the Space and the Notifications page. It holds the accessibility service and notification access, so Pocket XR itself needs neither, and it explains each one and asks before either is switched on.

PRIVACY
Pocket XR has no accounts, no ads and no tracking of its own. Your apps, windows, notifications and camera frames stay on your phone. Hand tracking runs on Google's MediaPipe library, which sends Google anonymous usage statistics while it runs. Details are in the privacy policy.

Pocket XR is free and open source (GPL-3.0): github.com/pocket-xr/pocket-xr

Pocket XR is not made by or affiliated with XREAL. "XREAL" and the glasses' names are XREAL's trademarks, used only to say what the app works with.

## App content answers

### Privacy policy

`https://github.com/pocket-xr/pocket-xr/blob/main/PRIVACY.md` (live once this branch is merged to main).

### Ads

"No, my app does not contain ads."

### App access

"All functionality is available without special access." There is no login. Add this note for the reviewer:

```
Pocket XR needs XREAL glasses (Aura, One, One Pro or 1S) on a phone with USB-C video out (for example a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7) to show its Space. Without glasses, the phone screens (trackpad, settings, Hands, Spatial windows) open and work, and the demo videos linked in the declarations show the glasses side. Shizuku (free on Google Play) is needed for app windows in the Space; without it apps open as Samsung DeX windows.
```

### Content rating (IARC questionnaire)

- Category: **All other app types** (a utility, not a game, not social, not a store).
- Violence, blood, sexuality, nudity, profanity, crude humour, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, gambling, fear: **No** to all.
- Does the app let users interact or exchange content with other users? **No.**
- Does the app share the user's current physical location with other users? **No.**
- Does the app let users buy digital goods? **No.**
- Is the app a web browser or search engine? **No.** (Its launcher searches only the installed apps.)
- Does the app contain unrestricted internet access or user-generated content? **No.** It shows other installed apps'
  windows, which carry their own ratings.

Expected result: Everyone / PEGI 3 / USK 0 (the rating authorities decide).

### Target audience and content

- Target age groups: **18 and over** only.
- Could the store listing unintentionally appeal to children? **No.**

### News app

No.

### COVID-19 contact tracing and status apps

No.

### Government app

No.

### Financial features

None.

### Health

No health features.

### Data safety

These answers follow from the code and from PRIVACY.md. The one thing that leaves the phone automatically is the usage
statistics Google's MediaPipe library sends while hand tracking runs (its log source `COREML_ON_DEVICE_SOLUTIONS`:
package name and version, MediaPipe and Android versions, the task and mode, latencies, frame counts, error codes; no
frames, no hand data, no identifiers). Play counts data an SDK sends as collected by the app, so it is declared.

**Data collection and security**

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Does your app collect or share any of the required user data types? | Yes |
| Is all of the user data collected by your app encrypted in transit? | Yes (MediaPipe sends it over HTTPS) |
| Do you provide a way for users to request that their data is deleted? | No (Haye & Co holds no user data; MediaPipe's statistics go to Google and carry no identifiers) |

**Data types**

| Data type | Collected | Shared | Processed ephemerally | Required or optional | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App info and performance: Diagnostics | Yes | No | No | Optional (only while hand tracking is on) | Analytics |
| App info and performance: Other app performance data | Yes | No | No | Optional (only while hand tracking is on) | Analytics |

Every other data type: **not collected**. In particular, none of these leave the phone: photos and videos (the glasses'
camera frames for hand tracking, recordings saved to Movies/Pocket XR), audio (never recorded), app activity and
installed apps (the launcher's list), messages and notifications (the add-on's Notifications page), device or other IDs,
location, contacts, files.

Why "Shared: No": Google receives the statistics as the provider of the MediaPipe library that runs inside Pocket XR,
not as a third party Pocket XR passes data to. If Mike prefers the most cautious answer, mark both rows as also shared
with Google; nothing else changes.

### Permissions Play will show and why (for any reviewer question)

| Permission | Why |
| --- | --- |
| CAMERA | The glasses' camera for hand tracking; Android also requires it before granting USB access to a camera device |
| RECORD_AUDIO | Never records. Android shows "Always open Pocket XR" for USB glasses with a microphone only to apps holding it |
| INTERNET, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE | The glasses' USB network (head tracking stream), the one-time hand model download |
| FOREGROUND_SERVICE, FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CAMERA | Hand tracking on the glasses' camera while the user has started it |
| FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CONNECTED_DEVICE, RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED | Keeping Pocket XR ready for the glasses' USB plug-in |
| POST_NOTIFICATIONS | The foreground services' notifications and setup prompts |
| BLUETOOTH_CONNECT | The Control Center's Bluetooth page (paired and connected devices) |
| VIBRATE | Trackpad taps |
| WAKE_LOCK | Added by a library (WorkManager) |
| moe.shizuku.manager.permission.API_V23 | Shizuku, which the user installs and starts |
| ADDON_LINK (signature) | The link to the Pocket XR add-on, signed by the same key |

Not in the release: SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW (debug builds only), QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES (not used; a `<queries>` element asks
only for launcher apps, DeX, Shizuku and the add-on), REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES, any location permission,
FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC (a library's unused service, removed from the manifest).

Short description:

```
The cursor and Notifications page for Pocket XR on XREAL glasses
```

Full description:

```
The Pocket XR add-on adds two optional features to Pocket XR, the multi-window workspace for XREAL glasses:

- The Pocket XR pointer: a cursor on the glasses outside Pocket XR's Space, moved with your hands or your phone's screen, which clicks, moves and resizes windows in Samsung DeX on the glasses.
- The Notifications page: your phone's notifications in the glasses, which you can open and clear.

Pocket XR is not an accessibility tool. The pointer uses Android's AccessibilityService API only to draw the cursor on the glasses, read where windows are on the glasses display, and perform the taps and drags you make there. The Notifications page uses notification access to read your notifications and show them in the glasses. The add-on explains each one and asks before either is switched on, and you can switch either off in Android's settings at any time.

Nothing the add-on reads is stored, collected or sent off the phone. It is shared only with the Pocket XR app on the same phone.

It works only with Pocket XR installed. Pocket XR is not made by or affiliated with XREAL. "XREAL" is XREAL's trademark.
```

Graphics: the same icon and feature graphic as Pocket XR, and screenshots 04 and 05 from [images/phone/](images/phone/)
(the Hands card and the pointer's disclosure) plus a screenshot of the notification disclosure if Mike wants a third.

Data safety: collects nothing, shares nothing ("No" to the first question). Its permissions: none beyond the two
services' bind permissions and the ADDON_LINK signature permission.
